This example uses dependency injection pattern to make code more testable. Each module accepts dependencies as parameters, so that you can pass in mocks in unit test.

Pros and cons:

Pros:
1. Each module can be fully tested, except the file that do the injection.
2. The code that does the injection is in a specified location (in this case index.ts) so that it can be easily ignored from coverage calculation.
3. Separation of concerns. Improve readability and code reuse.
4. It's very unlikely that you will aciddently run side effect code in unit test.

Cons:
1. index.ts is not covered, therefore potentially it is a risk.
2. In a large project, index.ts can contain a lot of lines which makes it difficult to read.


The dependency injection pattern can be represented as the following form:
```
Provider: (Dep1, Dep2, ...) => Service
```
where "Dep1", "Dep2", ... are types of the dependencies; "Service" is an object that contains business logic that works with the dependencies; and "Provider" is a function that constructs "Service".

A service can just a a dependency of an other module. Therefore we can write:
```
Provider: (Dep1, Dep2, ...) => Dep
```

In this example, we break down our initial problem into these providers:
```
ClientProvider: () => Client
WorkerProvider: Client => Worker
MainProvider: Worker => Main
```

The whole application can be written as calling these providers in a sequence:
```
c = ClientProvider()
w = WorkerProvider(c)
m = MainProvider(w)
m()
```

Can't we create a utility function that combines all these providers and that will be our main function?

Let's consider a provider as node in a graph that connects the output of a node to the matching input of other nodes. If all the nodes eventually connect to the main node, we can represent our application as a combination of the provider nodes. Obviously, this only requires each dependency defined has a coresponding provider.

Fortunately, a lot of libraries already provides frameworks that achieve our goal. [InversifyJS](https://inversify.io/) is one of them.
